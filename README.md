<h1 align="center">Age of Empires III &mdash; Improvement Mod</h1>
<h3 align="center"><i>Fallback ImpMod AI</i></h3>

<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p align="justify">
This repository contains the work-in-progress files for <a href="https://impmod.blogspot.com">ImpMod</a>'s fallback AI. The goal is to have a working AI that can be used as a fallback when there's an issue with the main AI. The AI is less complex than the main AI &mdash; the most noticeable difference being that it can't play on water maps &mdash; but it should be largely enough to provide a good experience for players while the main AI is being fixed.
</p>

<h2>How to use it?</h2>
<p align="justify">
When you use the patcher, there's a dropdown menu that allows you to select the AI you want to use. Select the option that says <code>Alistair_AI</code> &mdash; e.g. <code>AI_Alistair_v_1_10d</code> &mdash; and the patcher will automatically use the fallback AI instead of the main AI.
</p>

<h2>⚠️ Disclaimer ⚠️</h2>
<p align="justify">
Although this AI is offered as an option in the patcher, it's not directly part of the mod. It's just a hobby, a side project of mine. If you have any question regarding this AI, please contact me directly on Discord (<code>alistairjah</code>).
